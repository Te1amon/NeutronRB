# NeutronRB
Advanced anti-cheat for Roblox games developed by a single Lua developer, Te1amon

\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \

Serversided Checks:

Anti-HighJump/Anti-Fly

Anti-Speed

\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \

Clientside Checks:

RemoteSpys

Scripts such as FE Ban Hammer

Character Manipulation (Humanoid for example)

Infinite Yield Float

Gravity Manipulation 

\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \

Check releases for rbxm files

Also, I recommend not opening the clientside part of the anti-cheat (unless you have a good pc) due to it having many fake unused varibles (in case people decompile the localscript)
